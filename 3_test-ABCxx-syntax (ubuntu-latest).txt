2024-04-04T17:29:45.7632107Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7633683Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7635570Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7636665Z 
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7637376Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7639684Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7640688Z 
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7641110Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7641775Z 
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7642075Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7642746Z 
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7643085Z   git switch -
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7643471Z 
2024-04-04T17:29:45.7644206Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
